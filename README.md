##Introduction

The market for Ayurvedic and herbal medicine and supplements is expanding quickly, necessitating a centralized marketplace connecting consumers with providers. The ultimate goal of our web-based system development effort is to facilitate safe, efficient, and convenient commerce between buyers and sellers of a diverse selection of goods and services. A percentage of each transaction will be taken as a fee for using the platform, making commission the primary source of revenue for the platform.
